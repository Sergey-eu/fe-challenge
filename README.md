[![N|Solid](https://blobs.gitbook.com/spaces%2F-LC0OOaYNhLAKEG18CVO%2Favatar.png?generation=1525813064181835&alt=media)](https://reactjs.org/)
#### Features
According to the requirements, the entered data will be saved when the user navigates between pages.. 

Since the â€œClear button" was not required, saving data after refreshing the page can be inconvenient. Therefore, data is not saved anywhere except for the state

The application consists of a home page and two form pages.

The first step is available at the following URL: `localhost:3000/form/step1`.
If the user goes to `localhost:3000/form`, he will be redirected to `localhost:3000/form/step1`.

If the user goes to `localhost:3000/form/step2` without completed step 1, he will be redirected to `localhost:3000/form/step1`.

If the user goes to `localhost:3000/form/{any-text}`, he will receive an error page with links to the first step and home page.

#### Tech
* [React-scripts](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik ) - StarterKit with HMR, web-server an building tool
* [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik ) - Form engine
* [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup ) - Form validation
* [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui ) - ReactJS material components
* [MUI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui ) - Pure CSS material components

The tasks set do not require state managers and the simple API does not require special libraries

#### Installation 
Application requires Node v10+ to run. 
To start development, just install the dependencies and start the server
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

#### Notes 
The data submitted by the form can be checked at this URL: [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/76c989af-0b79-419d-ab0e-508ac1b93b44 )

Existing users for Automplete on the first step fetched from: [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=50&nat=au&exc=login )

> A [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=50&nat=au&exc=login ) was unavailable a while ago. 
>
> Therefore, just uncomment the code in the `handleAutocomplete` function 
> to work with the application without access to the user API.

The project contains a folder **data** with available configurations and data.

Unfortunately, frontend Unit test are not included into this progect.
