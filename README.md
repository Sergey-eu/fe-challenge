##### Features
According to the requirements, the entered data must be saved when the user navigates between pages. 

Since the â€œClear button" was not required, saving data after refreshing the page can be inconvenient. Therefore, data is not saved anywhere except for the state

The application consists of a home page and two form pages.

The first step is available at the following URL: `localhost:3000/form/step1`.
If the user goes to `localhost:3000/form`, he will be redirected to `localhost:3000/form/step1`.

If the user goes to `localhost:3000/form/step2` without completed step 1, he will be redirected to `localhost:3000/form/step1`.

If the user goes to `localhost:3000/form/{any-text}`, he will receive an error page with links to the first step and home page.
